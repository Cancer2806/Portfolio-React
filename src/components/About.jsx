      <p>Amongst other things, I enjoy travelling and producing items with a purpose.  I pursued my interests in computers and my desire to create worthwhile things by enrolling in the Full Stack Web Developers Bootcamp.  I am looking forward to further building a career in web development through the creation of products that will make the World a better place, even if only in a small way.</p>
